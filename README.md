Repository for the code used in Arduino Pro Mini boards to detect key presses on the analog pins from the voltage dividers created by the keys/buttons on the car CD player.

The detected key presses are then sent to the MH-M18 Bluetooth module by pulling down the module's KEY pin via appropriate resistors defined in the module datasheet.
